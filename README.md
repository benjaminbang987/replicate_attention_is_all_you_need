# Replicate Attention Is All You Need Model from Scratch
Since I learn the best by implementing the actual code, I'll attempt to replicate the Transformer model from
the original source: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor/blob/master/tensor2tensor/models/transformer.py
and another example of replication in pytorch in: https://github.com/jadore801120/attention-is-all-you-need-pytorch without explicitly copy-pasting the code.


All rights to the code, inspiration and the model belongs to the original paper & Github repo.
